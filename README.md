# Competitive-Analysis-of-Classification-in-traditional-Machine-Learning-vs-Neural-Networks
Project to showcase the performance differences of Traditional ML Algorithms and Neural Networks on different kinds of Datasets.  We have implemented Different traditional ML algoritms and Neural Networks on different on 3 different types of datasets (Text, Image and Audio) and compared their performances by using graphical representations and accuracy numbers.
